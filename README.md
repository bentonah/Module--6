# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

I created a command-line Hangman game using the Rust programming language. The game allows the user to guess letters and attempt to uncover a secret word within a set/limited number of attempts. Variables are used to store the data/information needed for the game. Expressions are used to evaluate conditions and perform calculations in the game. Conditions and loops are used with the main game logic to allow the user to continue guessing, and to recognize when a correct letter has been chosen. Object-oriented techniques are also used to define a 'Hangman' struct.

I created this software so that I could not only learn a new language, but also further my learning and understanding of the Rust language, so that I am able to succeed and do better if I have to work with it in the future. By building this game, I ensured I had a program that was not too complex, but one that also forced me to learn and improve upon its syntax and principles.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I developed this game using the Rust programming language. I did so using Visual Studio Code, with the Rustup toolchain.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Add more error handling and improve it so that it provides better feedback to the player.
- Implement difficulty levels or different maximum attempts.
- Add a feature that allows users to input their own custom words, or choose the number of letters that the word will be.
- Add a user interface and make it look nice and visually appealing so that it is more engaging for the user.
